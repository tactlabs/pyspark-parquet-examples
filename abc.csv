Jnr. Cloud Engineer,State Street,"Toronto, ON","Job type
Full-time","Who we are
Although not a household name, State Street is one of the world’s largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community. We touch $39 trillion in assets every day and are the world’s third largest investment manager with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management. To do this we manage as much data as one of the internet giants on nearly as large a technical footprint.
Recently we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.
This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).
What you will do:
As a cloud engineer, you will deploy solutions in the public cloud (e.g., AWS) using configuration provisioning and management tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Python APIs). You are required to design configuration templates that are used to provision infrastructure components (i.e., EC2, RDS, EMR, Lambda etc.) in a scalable manner. Once in production your role is key to ensuring that solutions are performant and operational SLAs are maintained.
Develop applications (the ‘thread or if you prefer ‘duct tape’) that enable business and operational requirements using cloud provider services (‘fabric’ or ‘lego pieces’)
Make concepts ‘real’ by telling enterprise architects how things really work versus what they may have seen in a vendor demo
Avoid 2am production issues by building scalable and resilient (‘works the first time’) applications running globally
Make things better by pointing out redundancies and manual steps best handled via your code
Who you are:
Smart and prefer to have other fork your git repos (versus forking some open source project to show commit counts)
Experience using languages in vogue this decade (e.g., Python, Go, Groovy)
Aware of how cloud-centric architectures and technical standards differ from something that runs on a Windows server
Understand what are trade-offs in design and development (e.g., perennial issues around cache validation)
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering
Bonus Points:
Graduate degree in Computer Engineering / Computer Science
GPA higher than the average in relevant subjects and in the last two academic years (if not throughout)
Prior experiences / internships with exposure to developing large scale applications
Have written apps using AWS services (a bit more than EC2 is always welcome)
About State Street
Across the globe, institutional investors rely on us to help them manage risk, respond to challenges, and drive performance and profitability. We keep our clients at the heart of everything we do, and smart, engaged employees are essential to our continued success.
Our promise to maintain an environment where every employee feels valued and able to meet their full potential infuses our company values.

"Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Modeling), Risk",Square,"Toronto, ON","Job type
Full-time","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

As a Machine Learning Engineer within the Risk Machine Learning team, you work on projects that enable a software driven, machine learning centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

Our algorithms derive value from our unique and rich data from our entire product portfolio within our rapidly growing seller ecosystem. We partner with business, product, operations and engineering teams to drive optimal decision making systems using sophisticated modeling and machine learning. We’re a passionate team of entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers who are shipping machine learning software that actively actively manages Square’s view on each transaction as it pertains to our revenue growth and risk.

You Will
Build and deploy machine learning/deep learning models that detect risk (credit or fraud) activity in real time across our Seller’s ecosystem consisting of payments, banking and debit card products.
You will leverage experimentation mindset along with state-of-the-art algorithms to drive down false positives, collaborate on new product features to drive losses down and explore new datasets (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for risk models.
Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models

Qualifications

You Have
An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics, or a related technical field.
PhD. plus 2 years (or Master plus 5 years) industry working experience on applied Machine learning or Deep learning
A strong track record of performing machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) and SQL/NoSQL interaction patterns.
Expert level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., transformer network architectures, with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large scale production setting. Reinforcement learning experience is a plus for developing optimal control policies
Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation.
Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business.
The ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers).

Jnr. Cloud Engineer,State Street,"Toronto, ON","Job type
Full-time","Who we are
Although not a household name, State Street is one of the world’s largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community. We touch $39 trillion in assets every day and are the world’s third largest investment manager with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management. To do this we manage as much data as one of the internet giants on nearly as large a technical footprint.
Recently we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.
This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).
What you will do:
As a cloud engineer, you will deploy solutions in the public cloud (e.g., AWS) using configuration provisioning and management tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Python APIs). You are required to design configuration templates that are used to provision infrastructure components (i.e., EC2, RDS, EMR, Lambda etc.) in a scalable manner. Once in production your role is key to ensuring that solutions are performant and operational SLAs are maintained.
Develop applications (the ‘thread or if you prefer ‘duct tape’) that enable business and operational requirements using cloud provider services (‘fabric’ or ‘lego pieces’)
Make concepts ‘real’ by telling enterprise architects how things really work versus what they may have seen in a vendor demo
Avoid 2am production issues by building scalable and resilient (‘works the first time’) applications running globally
Make things better by pointing out redundancies and manual steps best handled via your code
Who you are:
Smart and prefer to have other fork your git repos (versus forking some open source project to show commit counts)
Experience using languages in vogue this decade (e.g., Python, Go, Groovy)
Aware of how cloud-centric architectures and technical standards differ from something that runs on a Windows server
Understand what are trade-offs in design and development (e.g., perennial issues around cache validation)
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering
Bonus Points:
Graduate degree in Computer Engineering / Computer Science
GPA higher than the average in relevant subjects and in the last two academic years (if not throughout)
Prior experiences / internships with exposure to developing large scale applications
Have written apps using AWS services (a bit more than EC2 is always welcome)

"Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Modeling), Risk",Square,"Toronto, ON","Job type
Full-time","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

As a Machine Learning Engineer within the Risk Machine Learning team, you work on projects that enable a software driven, machine learning centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision.

Staff Software Engineer (Remote),The Trade Desk,"Toronto, ON","Job type
Full-time","The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100 times the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.
About the Role:
Our Senior & Staff Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.
Senior Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
Who We Are Looking For:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
What We Care About:
What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you.

Full-time","About Citylitics
What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.
Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.
Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the market & opportunity intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.
Who Are We Looking For?
We are looking for a product-centric Full Stack Developer who enjoys building both frontends and backends, and has prior exposure to large-scale cloud web services. Reporting to our Software Team Manager and working closely with Product Managers and peer developers, you will play an instrumental role in executing on our ambitious Product Roadmap.
We have developed the largest and fastest growing data platform on North American infrastructure with over 1 Billion public documents from over 31,000 cities and utilities in the US & Canada, triangulated with dozens of government data sources, and refreshed every two weeks. We are now quickly expanding into new industries ranging from public transportation, roads and highways, power, gas, healthcare, waste management, and more. You will make a major impact on the success of our platform as we expand rapidly and unlock new use cases for our users.
Our ideal candidate brings a ""do what needs to be done"" attitude, has a strong sense of ownership, and thrives in a fast-paced development environment. We expect you to be collaborative, solutions-oriented, and a key contributor to our Sprint Planning and Backlog prioritization. You will have gone through at least one end-to-end product development cycle with an aptitude for bringing intuitive user experiences to life. This is an excellent opportunity for someone looking to take the next step in their career at a purpose-focused, fast-growing start-up.
Most of our team is based out of Toronto but we are working remotely due to COVID-19. We are open to fully remote candidates but have a preference for candidates based in Toronto, Kitchener/Waterloo, Milwaukee, Chicago, or Austin. We have offices in Toronto, Milwaukee, and Austin.
What Will You Accomplish?
Work closely with a cross-functional team including product managers, developers, client success managers, and intelligence analysts to understand user needs requirements from our data infrastructure and develop solutions to improve product delivery and end-user experience.
Execute on our Product Roadmap by building & implementing new features and developing solutions to our most pressing technical and user challenges
Design, implement, build and maintain our large and distributed, high availability microservices, internal tools, user interfaces, and deployment systems
Live Outside The Box: You are empowered by Team Leaders to seek out and adapt the latest software technologies to develop the functionality that will improve our user experience and product quality.

Backend: A Python Django Application serves our frontend and APIs. A Kubernetes cluster for our data ingestion and processing which feeds a MySQL database and an Elasticsearch cluster.
Infrastructure: We deploy a number of Docker containers to the Google Cloud Platform and use various services like Cloud Vision, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Pub/Sub. Our deployments are coordinated with Cloud Build. Logs are maintained via Kibana.
Requirements
At least 2 years of production quality code at scale
Degree in a Computer Science / Software Engineering field or equivalent practical experience.

A passion for quality, an obsession with automation and a love for writing clean, effective code + documentation.
A drive to be involved in the entire development cycle, from planning through monitoring in production.

Full-time","About Citylitics
Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets
What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.
Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.
Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the market & opportunity intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

You'll find simple, elegant solutions to hard problems
